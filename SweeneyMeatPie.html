    <h4><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h4>
    <p><b>Crust</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, stir the flour and salt together until combined. Heat the butter and water together until
            very hot. Stir the hot water into the flour mixture and stir until it comes together as a ball of dough.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 5 balls of dough, weighing about 130g each. Divide the fifth ball into four smaller
            balls, these will be for the lid.</li>
        <li>Take a round glass jar or wooden mold with straight edges (I just used glass jam jars) and lightly grease it
            with vegetable oil. Press the mold or the bottom of the jar onto one of the larger ball of dough to flatten
            it. With your hands, start to mold and pull the dough up the sides of the jar until it's about 3 inches
            tall. Turn the jar upside down and refrigerate it for 30 minutes or until firm and dry. Gently remove it
            from the jar. The crust should now stand up straight on it's own.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Filling</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>While the crust is drying, heat a saucepan on medium heat with a bit of oil. Once hot, add the onions and
            cook for 3 minutes until translucent. Add the diced carrots and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the ground
            pork and beef and start breaking it up into small pieces with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Add the dried sage and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Add the flour and stir to combine. Cook for 1
            minute. Add the stock and cook until it starts to bubble. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside to
            cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven 350F.</li>
        <li>Fill each standing crust with the meat filling. Roll out the tops and place it on top. Place a bit of egg
            wash to help adhere the two pieces. Place it on a baking tray and egg wash. Cut a few small slits on top for
            ventilation.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool before serving.</li>
    </ol>
